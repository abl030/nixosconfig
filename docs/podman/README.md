# Podman Docs

Minimal documentation for current Podman container operations.

## Keep

- Current state: `docs/podman/current/state.md`
- Future direction (one-day plans): `docs/podman/current/future-plan.md`

## Removed

Historical phase plans, decision logs, incident notes, and deep research snapshots were removed to reduce maintenance overhead and keep this track focused on what is true now and what might happen next.
