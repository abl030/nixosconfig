# Podman Current State

Last updated: 2026-02-14

## Scope

This document records current, observed behavior for container stacks managed by `stacks/lib/podman-compose.nix`.

## Runtime Model

1. Stack lifecycle owner is the user unit `${stackName}.service`.
2. Deploy path is `podman compose up -d --remove-orphans` (no deploy-time `--wait`).
3. Startup timeout is bounded (`startupTimeoutSeconds`, default 300 seconds).
4. Env files are sourced from system-scope `sops.secrets` paths; legacy fallback support exists for one release.
5. Auto-update invariant is enforced as hard-fail:
   - If `io.containers.autoupdate=registry` is present, `PODMAN_SYSTEMD_UNIT` must be present.
6. Unit files for stack services are generated by Home Manager into `~/.config/systemd/user/...`.

## Rebuild and Change Propagation

1. Compose and env file changes are represented as new Nix store paths and updated unit references.
2. Rebuild does not use compose health gating (`--wait`), so activation is not blocked on runtime health convergence.
3. A documented `igpu` test showed that stale user-level unit artifacts in `~/.config/systemd/user` can cause restarts to continue using old unit definitions even when `/etc/systemd/user` is updated.
4. In that test, removing stale user-level unit artifacts switched `FragmentPath` to `/etc/systemd/user/...` and the updated compose command was then observed.
5. This is now treated as an ownership-collision risk between unit sources, not a compose-wrapper bug.

## Phase 2.5 Direction (Accepted, Implemented In Code)

1. Keep stack lifecycle in user scope (`${stackName}.service` remains user service).
2. Unit ownership is migrated from NixOS `/etc/systemd/user` generation to Home Manager `~/.config/systemd/user` generation.
3. Single ownership per unit name is enforced operationally (no dual `/etc` and `~/.config` resolution accepted).
4. Post-switch ownership checks use `FragmentPath` and `DropInPaths` as operational invariants.
5. Treat "user manager unavailable" as a reconciliation failure condition that must be surfaced explicitly.

## Implementation and Validation Status

1. Stack unit ownership migration is implemented in the shared stack library (`stacks/lib/podman-compose.nix`).
2. Ownership assertions now run in Home Manager activation after `reloadSystemd`.
3. Non-prod local e2e validation completed on `wsl` using two dummy stacks (`restart-probe`, `restart-probe-b`), including mutation propagation.
4. Production-style rollout validation on `igpu` and `proxmox-vm` (`doc1`) is still pending.
