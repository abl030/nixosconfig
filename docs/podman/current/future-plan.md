# Podman One-Day Plans

This is intentionally short and non-committal.

## Likely Next Directions

1. Evaluate Quadlet migration for high-value stacks first.
2. Evaluate native Nix container orchestration as a longer-term replacement for compose-managed stacks.
3. If either migration starts, do it incrementally with one-stack canaries and explicit rollback steps.

## Not Planned Right Now

1. Immediate platform rewrite.
2. Broad refactor while current rootless compose operations are stable.
