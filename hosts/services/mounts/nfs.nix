# This mounts via tailscale. I now have access controls so that no one can see nfs shares unless they are on tailscale.
# Here's the uraid NFS rules:
# 100.70.190.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,anonuid=99,anongid=100,all_squash) 192.168.1.0/24(sec=sys,root_squash,noaccess)
# The id stuff squashes all requests to nobody/users which is default unraid and just leads to less headaches.
