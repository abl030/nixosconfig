# define our hosts
# Our hostkey must match our hostname so that NIXD home completions work.
# Note this does mean at the moment we are limited to one user per host.
# In NVIM/lspconfig.lua you can see we pull in our home_manager completions
# programatticaly and this was the easiest way. Note that this is does not have to be the 'hostname' per se
# but merely this host key and the username must be the same.
