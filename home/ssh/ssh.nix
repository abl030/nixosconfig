# We are 100% in on tailscale SSH. The biggest problem is X11 forwarding. See: https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/5160
# So, what we do is make sure the normal sshd is running and either block it at the firewall for nix hosts or just set a unique 127.0.0.0/0 address for non-nix hosts.
# The hostname address in the matchblocks must be unique for each host, otherwise it will check known_hosts and fail.
# So we now have no open ports but still use X11 forwarding. #SECURE.
